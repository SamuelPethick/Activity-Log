Accomplishments and Outputs:

Steps Taken:

1. Create a new Dashboard Element as an Indicator, edit the text to display the sum of the "valid ballot" field adding a description changing it to our dark theme (black background, white text) and adding in a descriptive heading for the ballot data.
2. Go to the map settings and link the indicator to it from the map actions sub menu.
3. Also link the indicator to the feature layer selection in the layer action submenu, select the feature layer, and open the filter toggling the indicator on. 
4. Add a new Dashboard Element as a Guage, set it to the sum of the "electors field", set the guage to our dark mode theme. 
5. Link the guage to the map with the same process for the indicator in step 2.
6. Link the guage to the layer selection with the same process in step 3.
7. Create another indicator for voter turnout repeating steps 1 - 3.

8. Once the Dashboard is finished Share it, ensuring that the dashboard, map, and feature layers are all set to public sharing level on ArcGIS Online. 
9. Go to the Dashboards ArcGIS Online Contents page and copy the REST Endpoint URL, which we will use to embed it into the StoryMap.
10. In the StoryMAP add an embedded item, and use this REST Endpoint URL as the item reference, size the Dashboard appropriately.
