# Week 12 Activity Log

## Objective: Create a Dashboard with information on the 44th Canadian General Election by Voting District

### March 29th 2023

Time worked on: 30 minutes

Requirements: A web feature layer with data about the ridings voting patterns in 2021.

Accomplishments and outputs:

Steps Taken:

  1. After publishing the feature layer from ArcGIS Pro to ArcGIS Online open it in Map Viewer and Create a Map. (Be sure that both the feature layer and the map are set to sharing level: everyone)
  2. In map viewer make sure that the symbology correctly carried over (Symbolized by winning party with the party colour). 
  3. Create the ArcGIS Dashboard by referencing the map element on AGOL.
  4. Create a Pie Chart that displays total votes, symbolize with color corresponding to party on the map, add a filter that makes it update based on the map selection.
  5. Create a list including important election information such as; riding name, winning party, population, voter turnout, % of valid ballots, winning candidate. Make sure to link to the dashboard view. Be sure to use the real field name rather than alias in the {}
  6. Make it so ridings can be selected to display relevant information rather than based off of zoom by: entering the map configuration menu going to layer actions, dropping down the menu, and clicking "filter when selection changes"
  7. In the map congifuration menu under settings toggle "search" on, also toggle "zoom in/out" on.
